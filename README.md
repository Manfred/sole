# Sole

Sole helps with generating unique identifiers similar to a UUID or ULID but allows optional packing of metadata to make it useful for storage solutions.

By default any identifier generated by Sole contains an approximation of the current time. The time has reduced precision to reduce storage requirements.

```ruby
Sole.generate #=> 'VGPCCCCC4FPF97MM'
              #    ^^^^^^^^- seconds since epoch
              #              little endian order
              #              to help sharding
              #            ^^^^^^^^- random bytes
```

Sole identifiers work great as a key for AWS S3 objects because the start of the identifier is highly variable causing objects to be nicely distributed across backend servers.

When distributing objects it can be hard to debug their origin. Sole makes this easier by allowing you to pack additional data into the identifier.

```ruby
Sole.pack(43) #=> 'GG44FCCCFH4VWPXHHJHH'
              #    ^^^^^^^^- seconds since epoch
              #              little endian order
              #              to help sharding
              #            ^^^^^^^^- random bytes
              #                    ^^^^- packed data
```

Note that all packed data will be cast to a String so you may have to parse it.

```ruby
Sole.unpack("GG44FCCCFH4VWPXHHJHH") #=>
 [2018-06-08 16:02:32 +0200, "43"]
```
